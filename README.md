## Docs
Start the software like you would with any other .exe file

The software will ask you for values lower, upper, and step

### Lower
Lower is the lower limit of the table (where the table starts).

### Upper
Upper is the upper limit of the table (where the table ends).

### Step
This is the increment that the table works in, for example step of 1 would show every temperature between upper and lower and its equivalent values.
